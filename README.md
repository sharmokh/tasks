Tazks : Handyman Service Website

Considering the growing power of social apps such as Airbnb and Uber, this site is intended to support individuals with the ability to provide small services such as fixing a leaky facut or setting up a printer.

Site was thought of and developed over 4 years ago (in 2015) although this repository was only committed and pushed a few months ago.  Development for the site ended due to lack of resources.
